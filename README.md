# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🛠️

## About Me
Hello, I'm Periklis Petridis, a 3rd year Ph.D. student at MIT's Operations Research Center (ORC). I'm honored to be under the guidance of Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas. My core research interests include Mathematical Optimization, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, and I'm keen on applying these in practical scenarios. 

### Background 🎓
Before joining MIT, I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. During this period, I was a member of [Aristurtle](https://www.aristurtle.gr/el/%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE/), Greece's first Formula Student Driverless team. My undergraduate thesis focused on Optimization Methods for Low-Rank Matrix Approximation and their applications in System Identification.

### Areas of Interest 🔍
- Mathematical Optimization
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Applications in Healthcare, Renewable Energy, Sustainability
